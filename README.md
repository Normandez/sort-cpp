C++ Realizations of Sorting Algorithms

# Algorithms
* Bubble Sort - simplest sorting algo, just replacing of nearby elements, O(n^2)
* Selection Sort - build sorted array starts from first element to last by replacing smallest element with current i-th element after comparison, O(n^2)
* Insertion Sort - build sorted array by inserting every element of input array started from (l + 1) via comparison and replacing nearby elements, O(n^2)
* ShellSort - improved insertion sort via usage of range of comparison, O(n^2) but can be better depend on 'step' value
* Merge Sort - split input array on elementary parts and merge them into output sorted array by per-element comparison via recurse, O(n logn)
* QuickSort -
